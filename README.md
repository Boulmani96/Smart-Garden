# Smart-Garden
- The system consists of two software components: C++ for the ESP32 server in the Arduino IDE and Java programming in Android Studio for the Android app.
- In this project, a prototype for a smart garden system will be developed and tested. The prototype enables the collection, control and visualization of environmental data for irrigation and lighting in the garden.
The prototype consists of a central control unit ESP32, which is connected to various sensors and actuators. These sensors are designed to measure environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity. The collected data is recorded and analyzed by the ESP32 microcontroller. The actuators in this prototype enable the control of lighting and irrigation in the garden. They can be controlled depending on the environmental data collected to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.
Additionally, the prototype has an interface that allows the user to view the data in real time on an ILI9341 TFT LCD display or an Android app.
